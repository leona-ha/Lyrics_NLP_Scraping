# Web Scraping and Natural Languace Processing on Lyrics

**Goal: Build a text classification model to predict the artist from a piece of text.**

**Steps:**
1. Scrape lyrics from two or more artists on lyrics.com using BeautifulSoup and RegEx.
2. Text Preprocessing:  e.g. Tokenizing and Lemmatizing using Spacy
3. Simple Sentiment Analysis using vaderSentiment
4. Build a Text Classification Model that uses CountVectorisation, TFIDF-Transformation and a Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes Classifier to predict artists from song-lyrics.
