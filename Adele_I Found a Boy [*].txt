Painting pictures with my mind  Making memories using my eyes  Filling up my heart with golden stories  Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life  oh    Welcome sunrise with the morning glory  I ve changed my mind  There is no simple  I thought of me  I want to see  I want to feel my heartbeat so  With the world that you feel  leave    I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart  And it s teasing me  To scratch my itch and beat my drum  So I can start to begin what s begun    Painting pictures  Filling up my heart with golden stories    Painting pictures  Filling up my heart with golden stories    Running riots inside my soul  Fire burning and it s lighting me up  To scratch my itch and beat my drum  So I can finish what has begun    Painting pictures  Filling up my heart with golden stories    Painting pictures  Filling up my heart with golden stories
