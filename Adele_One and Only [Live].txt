I never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham  If it hadn t been for love  I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana  If it hadn t been for love  I never woulda run through the blindin  rain  Without one dollar to my name  If it hadn t been  if it hadn t been for love    I never woulda seen the trouble that I m in  If it hadn t been for love  Woulda been gone like a wayward wind  If it hadn t been for love  Nobody knows it better than me  I wouldn t be wishing I was free  If it hadn t been  if it hadn t been for love    Four cold walls against my will  At least I know he s lying still  Four cold walls without parole  Lord have mercy on my soul    Four cold walls against my will  At least I know he s lying still  Four cold walls without parole  Lord have mercy on my soul    I never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham  If it hadn t been for love  I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana  If it hadn t been for love  I never woulda loaded up a forty four  Put myself behind a jailhouse door  If it hadn t been  if it hadn t been for love  If it hadn t been  if it hadn t been for love  yes  If it hadn t been  if it hadn t been for love  yes
