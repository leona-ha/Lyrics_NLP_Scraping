This is how the story went  I met someone by accident  It blew me away  Blew me away    It was in the darkest of my days  When you took my sorrow and you took my pain  And buried them away  you buried them away    I wish I could lay down beside you  When the day is done  And wake up to your face against the morning sun  But like everything I ve ever known  You disappear one day  So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away    Dropped you off at the train station  Put a kiss on top of your head  Watch you wave  And watched you wave    Then I went on home to my skyscrapers  And neon lights and waiting papers  That I call home  I call that home    I wish I could lay down beside you  When the day is done  And wake up to your face against the morning sun  But like everything I ve ever known  You disappear one day  So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  away    Woke up feeling heavy hearted  I m going back to where I started  The morning rain  the morning rain  And though I wish that you were here  On that same old road that brought me here  It s calling me home  It s calling me home    I wish I could lay down beside you  When the day is done  And wake up to your face against the morning sun  But like everything I ve ever known  You disappear one day  So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  I can t spend my whole life hiding my heart away
