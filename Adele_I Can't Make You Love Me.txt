Turn down the lights  Turn down the bed  Turn down these voices  Inside my head    Lay down with me  And tell me no lies  Just hold me closly  Don t patronize    Don t patronize me     Cause I can t make you love me  If you don t  You can t make your heart feel  Something that it won t  And even in the dark  These final hours  I will lay down my heart  I will feel the power  But you won t  No  you won t   Cause I can t make you love me  When you don t  When you don t  yeah    I ll close my eyes   Cause then I don t see  The love you don t feel  When you re holding me    Morning will come  And I ll do what s right  Just give me till then  To give up this fight    And I will give up this fight     Cause I can t make you love me  If you don t  You can t make your heart feel  Something that it won t  And even in the dark  These final hours  I will lay down my heart  I will feel the power  But you won t  No  you won t   Cause I can t make you love me  When you don t  When you don t  ooh don t  You  when you don t  yeah  yeah
